#React Query?
-A library for fetching data in React application

#Why
-1.Since react is a UI libray ,there is no specific pattern for data fetching
2. useEffect hook for data fetching and useState hook to maintain component state like loading,error or resulting data

3.if the data is needed throughtout the app, we tend to use state management libraries 
4. Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client state. i.e-"theme" for the application/whether a modal is open 
5. State Mangament libraries are not great for working with asychronous or server state
